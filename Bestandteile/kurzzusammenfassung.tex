Atmosphere is one of the most memorable aspects of video games. It describes the feeling of a particular game and how it is remembered by the user. Although it is strongly linked to the commercial success of a video game, game atmosphere has not received much attention in scientific research. It is in fact not even clearly defined in the literature. Therefore, this term paper will first try to provide a clear definition of the term "game atmosphere". Then, some techniques are discussed to create a desired atmosphere by changing and composing the visual effects and especially the lighting in a scene. Finally, some techniques to create a desired atmosphere will be illustrated on a serious game that was developed in parallel to this thesis.
